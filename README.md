# Movie-Project
This project was similar to the IMDb website which you can search for movies, actors and see popular movies, tv shows etc. In this project, my partner and I've used object-oriented programming and MovieDb API to fetch the necessary movie data. Also, I used vanilla JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap with CSS for styling.

- Topics practised: Pair-programming, Object oriented programming, Bootstrap

- Technologies used: JavaScript, MovieDB API, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS
